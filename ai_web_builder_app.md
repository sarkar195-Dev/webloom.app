# AI-Powered Web Builder Architecture

## Overview
The AI-powered web builder is designed to simplify web development through automation and intelligent features. This document outlines its architecture, frontend and backend setup, MVP phases, tech stack, and monetization strategies.

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: A responsive web interface enabling users to create and edit their websites with a user-friendly drag-and-drop interface.
- **Backend**: An AI engine that processes user inputs and generates optimized code, supporting various design templates and customizations.

## Frontend Setup
- Built using React.js for a dynamic and responsive UI.
- Integrated with Redux for state management.
- Utilizes CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Backend AI Engine
- Developed in Python using TensorFlow for AI model training.
- API endpoints built using Flask to serve AI functionalities.
- Manages data storage and user sessions using a relational database (PostgreSQL).

## Live Preview System
- Users can see real-time changes in their designs without refreshing the page.
- WebSockets implemented for live communication between frontend and backend.

## MVP Phases
1. **Phase 1**: Basic functionality to create a website using templates.
2. **Phase 2**: AI-driven suggestions for design improvements and content.
3. **Phase 3**: Integration of live preview and collaboration tools.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js, Redux, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, TensorFlow
- **Deployment**: Docker, AWS for cloud hosting

## Monetization Strategy
- Subscription model for premium features.
- One-time payments for specific templates or AI functionalities.
- Advertisement placements on free-tier accounts.
